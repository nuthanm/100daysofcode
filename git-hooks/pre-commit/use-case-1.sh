# Use Case: We create a files but never used in solution and forget those to remove all these files. At some time during clean up developers take time to identify all unused files and it is a big work for every one. To prevent all these, While commiting itself if we check if any unused file then commit should not trigger.
# We acheived using "pre-commit" hook.
