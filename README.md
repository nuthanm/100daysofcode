## Use Cases
1. Create 100 folders in Day 1, Day 2,...., Day 100 format and in each folder C-Sharp, Python and Powershell folders:
   - [Dynamic Folders Creation - Code - Chsarp](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%201/C-Sharp/Create-Dynamic-Folders.cs)
   - [Dynamic Folders Creation - Code - Powershell](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%201/Powershell/create-dynamic-folders.ps1)
   - [Dynamic Folders Creation - Code - Python](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%201/Python/create-dynamic-folders.py)
   - **Achievement:** If you automate this process, you can save a lot of manual time.
2. Team member wise, number of PR's and their review comments
   - [Extract PR Details and its count - Code - Powershell](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%202/Powershell/Get-PR-Count-From-Each-Team-Member.ps1)
   - [Extract_PR_AND_Reviewer_Comments_Count_Details_Code_Powershell](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%202/Powershell/Get-PR-and-Reviewers-Count-From-Each-Team-Member.ps1)
   - **Achievement:** This automation helps in identify how many PR's and review comments for each PR from each Team member. All these stats helps to understand how developers are doing.
