# 100daysofcode
In this repository, we take every day use case and convert that into a project. We write code in c-sharp, python and powershell (If applicable).

## Programming and Scripting Languages
- C-Sharp
- Python
- Powershell

## Folder Structure 
- /Learning
- /git-hooks
   - /pre-commit

## Use Cases
1. Create 100 folders in Day 1, Day 2,...., Day 100 format and in each folder C-Sharp, Python and Powershell folders:
   - [Dynamic Folders Creation - Code - Chsarp](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%201/C-Sharp/Create-Dynamic-Folders.cs)
   - [Dynamic Folders Creation - Code - Powershell](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%201/Powershell/create-dynamic-folders.ps1)
   - [Dynamic Folders Creation - Code - Python](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%201/Python/create-dynamic-folders.py)
   - **Acheivement:** If you automate this process, you can save a lot of manual time.
2. Team member wise, number of PR's and their review comments
   - [Extract PR Details and its count - Code - Powershell](https://github.com/nuthanm/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day%202/Powershell/Get-PR-Count-From-Each-Team-Member.ps1)
